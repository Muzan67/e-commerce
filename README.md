# E-commerce Back End

My E-commerce App has been created to build the back end for an e-commerce site.

The application will assist a Manager of an internet retail company, a back end for their respective
e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies. Which will help my company stay at the forefront
of innovation and stay competitive with other e-commerce companies.
